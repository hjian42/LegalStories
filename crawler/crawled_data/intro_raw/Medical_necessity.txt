Medical necessity is a legal doctrine in the United States related to activities that may be justified as reasonable, necessary, and/or appropriate based on evidence-based clinical standards of care. In contrast, unnecessary health care lacks such justification.
Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term clinical medical necessity is also used.
