Child migration or "children in migration or mobility" (sometimes more generally "children on the move") is the movement of people ages 3â€“18 within or across political borders, with or without their parents or a legal guardian, to another country or region. They may travel with or without legal travel documents. They may arrive to the destination country as refugees, asylum seekers, or economic migrants.
