In legal terminology, erga omnes rights or obligations are owed toward all. For instance, a property right is an erga omnes entitlement and therefore enforceable against anybody infringing that right. An erga omnes right (a statutory right) can be distinguished from a right based on contract, which is unenforceable except against the contracting party.
Erga omnes is a Latin phrase which means "towards all" or "towards everyone".
