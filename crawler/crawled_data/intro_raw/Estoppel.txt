Estoppel is a judicial device in common law legal systems whereby a court may prevent or "estop" a person from making assertions or from going back on his or her word; the person being sanctioned is "estopped". Estoppel may prevent someone from  bringing a particular claim.  Legal doctrines of estoppel are based in both common law and equity. 
It is also a concept in international law.
