The physical proximity doctrine is a standard in criminal law for distinguishing between preparation and attempt.: 683  "Physical" refers to the physical element of a criminal act (actus reus), as distinguished from the mental element of a guilty mind (mens rea). When a person makes preparation to commit a crime, and one of the preparatory acts is close or proximate to the completed crime, the preparation is considered to have merged into being an actual attempt.: 683  The standard is not a clear bright line standard.: 683  The closer the preparatory act is to the completed crime, the stronger the case for calling it an attempt.: 683  The determination as to whether the standard has been met is a matter for the jury to determine.
