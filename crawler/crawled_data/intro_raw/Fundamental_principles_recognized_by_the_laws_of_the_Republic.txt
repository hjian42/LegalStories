In France, the fundamental principles recognized by the laws of the Republic (French: principes fondamentaux reconnus par les lois de la République, abbreviated to PFRLR) are certain principles recognized by the Constitutional Council and the Council of State as having constitutional force.
This notion is mentioned briefly in the preamble of the Constitution of 1946. The preamble of the constitution of 1958 references the 1946 preamble, and the constitutional judge, in their decision n°71-44 DC of 16 July 1971, gave constitutional force to this preamble.
