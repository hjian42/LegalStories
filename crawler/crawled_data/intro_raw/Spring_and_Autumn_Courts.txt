Spring and Autumn Courts (春秋决狱) were an ancient Chinese judicial system, in which judges judge how to convict a case based on the ideas of righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Spring and Autumn Courts began in the reign of Emperor Wu of Han and continued until the Tang dynasty when Confucianism and Jurisprudence merged to create the "unity of ritual and law".
