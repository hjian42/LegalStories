Terra nullius (, plural terrae nullius) is a Latin expression meaning "nobody's land". It was a principle sometimes used in international law to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a state's occupation of it. There are currently three territories sometimes claimed to be terra nullius: Bir Tawil (a strip of land between Egypt and Sudan), 4 pockets of land near the Danube due to the Croatiaâ€“Serbia border dispute, and parts of Antarctica, principally Marie Byrd Land.
