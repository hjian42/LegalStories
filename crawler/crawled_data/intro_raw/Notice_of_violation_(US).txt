Notices of violation are issued from Code Enforcement by local cities or towns when properties may be contrary to local codes and regulation, vehicles are substandard, inoperable or may have constituted a public nuisance. The ordinances under which violation notices or statements are performed vary from one country to another and between cities within a country or states.
