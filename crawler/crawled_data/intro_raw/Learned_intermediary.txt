Learned intermediary is a defense doctrine used in the legal system of the United States.  This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled its duty of care when it provides all of the necessary information to a "learned intermediary" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of tort suits. 
In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. 
This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hollis v Dow Corning Corp., 129 DLR 609 (1995).
