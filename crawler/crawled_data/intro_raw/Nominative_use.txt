Nominative use, also "nominative fair use", is a legal doctrine that provides an affirmative defense to trademark infringement as enunciated by the United States Ninth Circuit, by which a person may use the trademark of another as a reference to describe the other product, or to compare it to their own. Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of "trademark fair use" (sometimes called "classic fair use" or "statutory fair use").  All "trademark fair use" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the fair use doctrine in copyright law.  However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.The nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:

The product or service cannot be readily identified without using the trademark (e.g. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute).
The user only uses as much of the mark as is necessary for the identification (e.g. the words but not the font or symbol).
The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.  This applies even if the nominative use is commercial, and the same test applies for metatags.Furthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.Nominative use does not require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as "UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of passing off.
