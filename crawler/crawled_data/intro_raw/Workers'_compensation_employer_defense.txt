When a worker has an injury, all US states have a structure of laws designed to provide multiple benefits to that worker. These laws are referred to as workers’ compensation. They define the benefits, identify all of the parties, and dictate the manner and method for dispensing such benefits. When there is a dispute over the benefits or the injury itself, the employer and employee may find themselves in conflict within the system. These controversies are  resolved through either negotiation or a trial. The practice of representing the employer side is referred to as workers’ compensation employer defense.
