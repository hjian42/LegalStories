In law enforcement, a knock and talk is an investigative technique where one or more police officers approaches a private residence, knocks on the door, and requests consent from the owner to search the residence. This strategy is often utilised when criminal activity is suspected, but there is not sufficient evidence to obtain a search warrant.
