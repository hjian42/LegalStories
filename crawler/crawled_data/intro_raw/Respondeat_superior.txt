Respondeat superior (Latin:  "let the master answer"; plural:  respondeant superiores) is a doctrine that a party is responsible for (and has vicarious liability for) acts of their agents.: 794  For example, in the United States, there are circumstances when an employer is liable for acts of employees performed within the course of their employment.  This rule is also called the master-servant rule, recognized in both common law and civil law jurisdictions.In a broader scope, respondeat superior is based upon the concept of vicarious liability.
