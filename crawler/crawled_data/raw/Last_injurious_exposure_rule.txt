The Russia–United States maritime boundary was defined by an agreement made by the United States and the USSR in 1990 covering the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Arctic Ocean. The boundary line generally follows the  1867 Alaska Cession line, but the agreement has not entered into force. The USA ratified the USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement, but the USSR failed to ratify it before dissolving, and it has not been ratified by Russia.

The United States has entered maritime boundary agreements with Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, and with the United Kingdom in the Caribbean. The maritime boundary with Canada in the Atlantic was determined by the International Court of Justice in the Gulf of Maine Case . M.B.
