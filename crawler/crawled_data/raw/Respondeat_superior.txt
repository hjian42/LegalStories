In Alaska, where they are the oldest, there are eleven groups identified by the languages they speak. These are the Dena’ina or Tanaina , Ahtna or Copper River Athabascan , Deg Hit’an or Ingalik , Holikachuk , Koyukon , Upper Kuskokwim or Kolchan , Tanana or Lower Tanana , Tanacross or Tanana Crossing , Upper Tanana , Gwich'in or Kutchin , and Hän . The Alaskan Athabascan culture is an inland creek and river fishing  and hunter-gatherer culture. The Alaskan Athabascans have a matrilineal system in which children belong to the mother's clan, with the exception of the Yupikized Athabaskans .

Formerly they identified as a people by the word Tinneh . Taken from their own language, it means simply "men" or "people".

The Athabascan people hold potlatches which have religious, social and economic significance.

Dogs were their only domesticated animal, but were and are an integral element in their culture for the Athabascan population in North America.
