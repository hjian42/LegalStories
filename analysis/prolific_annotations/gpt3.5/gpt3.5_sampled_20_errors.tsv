32	Presumption_(Catholic_canon_law)	10	The 'no vehicles in the park' example feels a little overly simplistic, given that that rule is often used in law school 101 settings to discuss how interpretation can actually be more complicated than we would think (is a skateboard a vehicle? etc.), but overall it is useful for the story/explanation of the plain meaning rule.

35	Prosecutorial_discretion	11	"I think it mostly works, but I have some doubts about the language of the principle ""ensuring fairness,"" and the way the story compares what is clearly one football team trying to gain an unfair advantage with the party trying to change election laws. I don't know how this has been applied in practice, but I can imagine situations in which those trying to change election laws at the 'last minute' are those attempting to address racially biased gerrymandering or COVID-unsafe voting regulations. In those cases, the principle would not be 'ensuring fairness' (and might even be hindering it), but the story doesn't seem to allow for that circumstance. "	There is no issue.	There is no issue.

38	Purcell_principle	12	"1. Isn't the expression ""possession is nine-TENTHS of the law"", not ""nine points""? 2.

41	Remoteness_in_English_law	13	The example provided feels a little unnecessary. The story presents a metaphor of a town's 'rules' as a metaphor for laws.

44	Safe_harbor_(law)	14	"Mostly I think it is good. I don't like the part where it asks whether you can be held responsible for the broken window and then says ""The law says not necessarily. This is because the broken window is considered too remote."" If the broken window is too remote, then the answer to whether you can be held liable for the broken window isn't 'not necessarily,' the answer is 'no.' I think these few lines together just constitute poor writing and could be clarified. "	There is no issue.	There is no issue.	There is no issue.
