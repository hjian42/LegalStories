Question: Which of the following statements accurately describes the functionality doctrine in United States trademark law?



(A) The functionality doctrine allows manufacturers to protect specific features of a product by means of trademark law.

(B) The functionality doctrine provides grounds to grant federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.

(C) The functionality doctrine provides grounds to grant trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable.

(D) The functionality doctrine prevents manufacturers from protecting specific features of a product by means of trademark law, directing them instead to patent law for useful processes and copyright law for aesthetic features.



The right answer is (D). The functionality doctrine prevents manufacturers from protecting specific features of a product by means of trademark law. Instead, it directs them to use patent law for useful processes, machines, and material inventions, and copyright law for aesthetic features that make a product more appealing and commercially desirable.

Question: Imagine you're a tech company that has developed a new smartphone with a unique, curved screen design. This design not only makes the phone more aesthetically pleasing but also provides a more immersive viewing experience for users. You want to protect this design from being copied by competitors. According to the functionality doctrine, which of the following would be the most likely outcome?



(A) You can use trademark law to protect the curved screen design because it is aesthetically pleasing.

(B) You can use patent law to protect the curved screen design because it provides a more immersive viewing experience.

(C) You can use copyright law to protect the curved screen design because it is a creative work.

(D) You cannot protect the curved screen design because it is both aesthetically pleasing and provides a useful function.



The right answer is (D) You cannot protect the curved screen design because it is both aesthetically pleasing and provides a useful function. According to the functionality doctrine, you cannot use trademark law to protect specific features of a product that are either utilitarian or aesthetic. In this case, the curved screen design is both aesthetically pleasing (aesthetic functionality) and provides a more immersive viewing experience (utilitarian functionality). Therefore, it cannot be protected by trademark law. However, the company might be able to seek protection under patent law for the utilitarian aspect of the design and under copyright law for the aesthetic aspect.

(A) The baker cannot protect the speedy baking method under any circumstances.

(B) The baker can use trademark law to protect the aesthetic design of the cake.

(C) The baker can use patent law to protect the speedy baking method.

(D) The baker cannot use copyright law to protect the aesthetic design of the cake.



The right answer is (C) The baker can use patent law to protect the speedy baking method. The functionality doctrine prevents the use of trademark law to protect useful processes, but it does not prevent the use of patent law for this purpose. Therefore, the baker can potentially protect the speedy baking method through a patent.

Question: Which of the following best describes the concept of ""Safe Harbor"" in law?



(A) It is a provision that specifies that certain conduct will always violate a given rule.

(B) It is a provision that specifies that certain conduct will never violate a given rule.

(C) It is a provision that specifies that certain conduct may or may not violate a given rule depending on the circumstances.

(D) It is a provision that specifies that all conduct will violate a given rule.



The right answer is (B). A ""Safe Harbor"" in law is a provision that specifies that certain conduct will never violate a given rule. It provides a clear guideline for individuals to follow to ensure they are not in violation of the law. For example, in a law that prohibits reckless driving, a safe harbor provision might state that driving under 25 miles per hour will not be considered reckless driving.

Question: Imagine you're a software developer and you've created a new app that allows users to share videos. There's a law that says, ""Don't infringe on copyright."" But what does 'infringe' mean? It's a bit vague, isn't it? So, the law includes a 'safe harbor' provision that says, ""If you promptly remove videos when you receive a valid copyright infringement notice, you're definitely not infringing on copyright."" On the other hand, the law might also include an 'unsafe harbor' provision that says, ""If you ignore valid copyright infringement notices and do not remove the infringing content, you're definitely infringing on copyright."" One day, you receive a valid copyright infringement notice for a video on your app. What should you do to stay within the 'safe harbor'?



(A) Ignore the notice and do not remove the video.

(B) Promptly remove the video from your app.

(C) Leave the video on your app and wait for more notices.

(D) Report the user who uploaded the video to the police.



The right answer is (B). According to the 'safe harbor' provision in this scenario, the software developer would not be infringing on copyright if they promptly remove videos when they receive a valid copyright infringement notice. Therefore, to stay within the 'safe harbor', the developer should promptly remove the video from their app when they receive the notice.

Question: What is a potential limitation or exception of the safe harbor rule in law?



(A) Safe harbor rules always provide clear definitions of what is legal and illegal.

(B) Safe harbor rules can only be applied to traffic laws.

(C) Safe harbor rules can make it difficult to determine whether certain actions are legal or illegal when they fall outside the defined safe or unsafe harbors.

(D) Safe harbor rules are only applicable in maritime law.



The right answer is (C). Safe harbor rules provide clear guidelines for what is definitely legal (safe harbor) and what is definitely illegal (unsafe harbor). However, when actions fall outside these defined harbors, it can be more difficult to determine their legality. This is because they are left to be judged according to the more vague, overall standard. For example, in the driving scenario, if someone is driving between 25 and 90 mph, whether they are driving recklessly or not is not clearly defined by the safe or unsafe harbor and would depend on other factors.

Question: Which of the following best describes the concept of ""Tolling"" in law?



(A) It is a legal doctrine that allows for the immediate termination of a lawsuit after the statute of limitations has run.

(B) It is a legal doctrine that allows for the pausing or delaying of the running of the period of time set forth by a statute of limitations.

(C) It is a legal doctrine that allows for the extension of the period of time set forth by a statute of limitations without any specific reasons.

(D) It is a legal doctrine that allows for the acceleration of the running of the period of time set forth by a statute of limitations.



The right answer is (B). Tolling is a legal doctrine that allows for the pausing or delaying of the running of the period of time set forth by a statute of limitations. This means that a lawsuit may potentially be filed even after the statute of limitations has run, under certain circumstances such as the plaintiff being a minor, mentally incompetent, or the defendant being out of jurisdiction, among others.

Question: John, a resident of California, was involved in a car accident in 2015 caused by Peter, who was found to be driving under the influence. John suffered severe injuries and was in a coma until 2020. John's family was not aware of the legal procedures to file a lawsuit against Peter. In 2021, John decided to sue Peter for the damages. However, the statute of limitations for personal injury cases in California is two years. Considering the concept of ""tolling"", what is the likely outcome of this situation?



(A) John cannot sue Peter because the statute of limitations has expired.

(B) John can sue Peter because the statute of limitations was tolled while he was in a coma.

(C) John can sue Peter only if Peter agrees to extend the statute of limitations.

(D) John can sue Peter only if the court decides to apply equitable tolling.



The right answer is (B) John can sue Peter because the statute of limitations was tolled while he was in a coma. According to the concept of tolling, the statute of limitations can be paused if the plaintiff is unable to understand the situation or proceed with the lawsuit due to reasons such as being in a coma. Therefore, even though the statute of limitations for personal injury cases in California is two years, it was likely tolled during the period John was in a coma, allowing him to file a lawsuit against Peter in 2021.

Question: Which of the following situations does NOT typically allow for the tolling of the statute of limitations?



(A) The plaintiff is a minor.

(B) The defendant has filed for bankruptcy.

(C) The plaintiff is currently serving a prison sentence for a felony.

(D) The parties are in the middle of good-faith negotiations to resolve the dispute.



The right answer is (C). The plaintiff serving a prison sentence for a felony is not typically a reason for tolling the statute of limitations. The concept explanation mentions that the statute of limitations can be tolled if the plaintiff is a minor, mentally incompetent, or if the defendant has filed for bankruptcy, is not physically within a certain jurisdiction, or if the parties are engaged in good-faith negotiations. However, it does not mention the plaintiff's imprisonment as a reason for tolling.

Question: What does the legal maxim ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"" imply?



(A) An employer is not responsible for the actions of their employees.

(B) An employer is only responsible for their own actions, not those of their employees.

(C) An employer is responsible for the actions of their employees, as if they had performed the actions themselves.

(D) An employer can delegate tasks of a personal nature to their employees.



The right answer is (C) An employer is responsible for the actions of their employees, as if they had performed the actions themselves. This is because the maxim ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"" translates to ""He who acts through another does the act himself"", implying that an employer, or principal, is responsible for the actions of their employees, or agents, as if they had performed the actions themselves. This principle is often used in discussions of vicarious liability. However, it does not apply to tasks of a personal nature, which cannot be delegated.

Question: Consider a scenario where a renowned chef, Chef Gordon, hires an assistant, Tim, to help him in his busy kitchen. One day, Chef Gordon instructs Tim to prepare a dish using a specific recipe. However, Tim mistakenly uses an ingredient that a customer is allergic to, causing the customer to have a severe allergic reaction. The customer decides to sue. Who should be held responsible for the incident?



(A) Tim, because he was the one who prepared the dish.

(B) Chef Gordon, because he is the one who hired Tim.

(C) Both Chef Gordon and Tim, because they both had a role in the incident.

(D) The customer, because they should have informed the restaurant about their allergy.



The right answer is (B). According to the legal principle ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"", Chef Gordon, as the employer, is responsible for the actions of his employee, Tim. Even though Tim was the one who made the mistake, Chef Gordon is held responsible because Tim was acting as his agent, doing things Chef Gordon would have done if he had the time. This principle is often used when discussing an employer's liability for their employee's actions, also known as vicarious liability.

Question: According to the legal principle ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"", which of the following scenarios would NOT hold the principal responsible for the actions of their agent?



(A) Alice, Bob's assistant, signs a contract on Bob's behalf that results in a loss to the other party.

(B) Alice, Bob's assistant, makes a business deal that results in a profit for Bob's company.

(C) Alice, Bob's assistant, handles a dispute with a client that results in a lawsuit against Bob's company.

(D) Alice, Bob's assistant, attempts to paint a picture on Bob's behalf, who is a professional artist, and signs Bob's name to it.



The right answer is (D). According to the legal principle ""Qui facit per alium facit per se"", the principal is responsible for the actions of their agent, unless the task is of a personal nature. In this case, painting a picture and signing Bob's name to it is a personal task that only Bob, as the artist, can do. Therefore, Bob would not be held responsible for Alice's actions in this scenario.

Question: Which of the following scenarios best illustrates the legal principle of Actio libera in causa (a.l.i.c.)?



(A) A person who accidentally spills hot coffee on someone because they tripped.

(B) A person who, while sober, accidentally hits a pedestrian with their car.

(C) A person who gets drunk, decides to drive, and hits a pedestrian.

(D) A person who, while defending themselves, accidentally injures the attacker.



The right answer is (C). The principle of Actio libera in causa (a.l.i.c.) holds that a person can be held responsible for an offense even if they were not in control of their actions at the time, as long as they voluntarily created the conditions for the offense to occur. In this case, the person chose to drink and then drive, creating the conditions for the accident to happen.

Question: John, a professional boxer, is at a bar and has a few drinks. He starts to feel a bit tipsy and decides to provoke a fight with another patron, Mike, who is not a professional fighter. Mike tries to avoid the fight, but John keeps pushing him. Eventually, Mike has no choice but to defend himself and in the process, he accidentally breaks John's nose. John decides to press charges against Mike for assault. Based on the principle of Actio libera in causa, what is the likely outcome of this case?



(A) Mike will be held responsible for the assault because he broke John's nose.

(B) John will be held responsible for the assault because he provoked the fight.

(C) Both John and Mike will be held responsible for the assault.

(D) Neither John nor Mike will be held responsible for the assault.



The right answer is (B). John will be held responsible for the assault because he provoked the fight. According to the principle of Actio libera in causa, even though Mike was the one who physically hurt John, John can still be held accountable because he willingly created the situation that led to the offense. He voluntarily chose to provoke a fight, thus creating the conditions for the assault to happen.

Question: Which of the following scenarios does NOT illustrate the principle of Actio libera in causa (a.l.i.c.)?



(A) A person gets drunk, drives, and hits a pedestrian. They are held responsible for the accident because they voluntarily chose to drink and drive.

(B) A person starts a fight and gets hurt when the other person defends themselves. They are held responsible because they initiated the fight.

(C) A person accidentally slips on ice, causing them to bump into someone and knock them over. They are held responsible because they chose to walk on the icy path.

(D) A person takes a hallucinogenic drug, and while under its influence, they vandalize a property. They are held responsible because they voluntarily took the drug.



The right answer is (C). The principle of Actio libera in causa (a.l.i.c.) holds a person accountable for their actions if they voluntarily created the conditions for the offense to occur. In option (C), the person did not voluntarily create the condition (icy path) that led to the accident. Therefore, this scenario does not illustrate the principle of a.l.i.c.
