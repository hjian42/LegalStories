Abstention_doctrine	C	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	C	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	A	(1) No.  (2) Based on the definition and story alone, it is hard to conclude that A is the correct answer. Indeed, the background information provided in connection with the Abstention doctrine does not suggest that a clear violation of either federal or state law would preempt the application of such doctrine.  (3) I do not think that any changes are necessary for the questions, but do believe that the definition should provide more relevant information about the Abstentation doctrine, especially with respect to situations where the doctrine clearly would not apply.

Doctrine_of_foreign_equivalents	B	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	C	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	B	(1) No.  (2) I chose B instead of the suggested answer A. My rationale was that proper nouns, referring to specific persons or objects, are much less likely to have the same semantic meanings across different languages and therefore much less likely to cause the type of confusions that the Doctrine of foreign equivalents is intended to address. I did not choose A because believed that words from a language not commonly spoken in the United States can still cause confusions if such words have the same meaning with certain English words.  However, after reading the rationale for the suggested answer, I do acknowledge that the choice A makes sense to the extent that if most people do not realize that a foreign word has a similar meaning to certain English words, then the confusion to be addressed by the doctrine might not exist at all.

Pacta_sunt_servanda	B	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	B	(1) No.  (2) Instead of choosing the suggested answer C, I selected B on the reasoning that "agreements must be kept" is a normative statement which addresses what should happen, rather than a descriptive statements that provides what must happen as a matter of fact. On that assumption, I believed that the contract can certainly be breached as long as one party chooses to do so but such party must face legal consequences because it should have breached the contract.  The suggested answer proceeds on a different assumption - it assumes that actions in the world striclty comply with the "Pacta sunt servanda" doctrine and accordingly the party just would not breach the contract.  (3) My suggestion: The prompt of the question should change to "According to the principle of 'Pacta sunt servanda', if a party breaches a contract, what should happen" or "Assuming that all people in the world take actions in strict compliance with the doctrine 'Pacta sunt servanda', what would happen?" This would help provide clarity on the underlying assumptions of the question. 	A	(1) Yes.  (2) The suggested answer is correct.   (3) No further suggestions. 	Medium
