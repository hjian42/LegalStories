0	Abstention_doctrine	"An abstention doctrine is any of several doctrines that a United States court may (or in some cases must) apply to refuse to hear a case if hearing the case would potentially intrude upon the powers of another court. Such doctrines are usually invoked where lawsuits involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).
The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case.

11	Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)	"A constitutional convention is an informal and uncodified tradition that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those Commonwealth of Nations states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government, and in some cases not at all.
Some constitutional conventions operate separately from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867. In others, notably the United Kingdom, which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification)."	179
94	Unaccompanied_minor	"An unaccompanied minor (sometimes ""unaccompanied child"" or ""separated child"") is a child without the presence of a legal guardian.
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child defines unaccompanied minors and unaccompanied children as those ""who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so."" The Committee defines separated children as those ""who have been separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary care-giver, but not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult family members.""

90	Substantial_certainty_doctrine	"In law, the substantial certainty doctrine is the assumption of intent even if the actor did not intend the result, but knew with substantial certainty the effect would occur as a result of his action. The doctrine can be used by courts as a test to determine whether or not a defendant committed a tort. For example, in Garratt v. Dailey (1955), the Washington Supreme Court remanded a case back to the lower courts to determine whether or not the five year-old defendant ""knew with substantial certainty that the plaintiff would attempt to sit down where the chair which he moved had been.""

50	Learned_intermediary	"Learned intermediary is a defense doctrine used in the legal system of the United States.  This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled its duty of care when it provides all of the necessary information to a ""learned intermediary"" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of tort suits. 
In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. 
This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hollis v Dow Corning Corp., 129 DLR 609 (1995).

18	Doctrine_of_foreign_equivalents	"This article discusses the trademark doctrine regarding translation of foreign words. For the patent doctrine regarding equivalent means to practice an invention, see Doctrine of equivalents.The doctrine of foreign equivalents is a rule applied in United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.

78	Prosecutorial_discretion	"In common law, the principle of prosecutorial discretion allows public prosecutors a wide latitude to decide whether or not to charge a person for a crime, and which charges to file. A similar principle in continental law countries is called the principle of opportunity.
The principle of opportunity is encoded in law in The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Slovenia and France. Some similar provisions exist in Belgian law and apparently in Estonian law.   By contrast, in the countries that do not recognise the principle of opportunity, compulsory prosecution applies, and the cancellation of the prosecution of a known felony can itself be considered a felony.

87	Safe_harbor_(law)	"A safe harbor is a provision of a statute or a regulation that specifies that certain conduct will be deemed not to violate a given rule.  It is usually found in connection with a more-vague, overall standard.  By contrast, ""unsafe harbors"" describe conduct that will be deemed to violate the rule.
For example, in the context of a statute that requires drivers to ""not drive recklessly"", a clause specifying that ""driving under 25 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed not to constitute reckless driving"" is a ""safe harbor"".  Likewise, a clause saying that ""driving over 90 miles per hour will be conclusively deemed to constitute reckless driving"" would be an ""unsafe harbor"".  In this example, driving between 25 miles per hour and 90 miles per hour would fall outside of either a safe harbor or an unsafe harbor, and would thus be left to be judged according to the vague ""reckless"" standard.

35	FTC_v._Dean_Foods_Co.	"FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597 (1966), is a 1966 decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may sue in federal court to obtain a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo against the consummation of a merger that the agency persuasively contends violates the antitrust laws.More broadly, the Dean Foods case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the ""All Writs Act,"" seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action.

100	Volenti_non_fit_injuria	"Volenti non fit iniuria (or injuria) (Latin: ""to a willing person, injury is not done"") is a common law doctrine which states that if someone willingly places themselves in a position where harm might result, knowing that some degree of harm might result, they are not able to bring a claim against the other party in tort or delict. Volenti applies only to the risk which a reasonable person would consider them as having assumed by their actions; thus a boxer consents to being hit, and to the injuries that might be expected from being hit, but does not consent to (for example) his opponent striking him with an iron bar, or punching him outside the usual terms of boxing.  Volenti is also known as a ""voluntary assumption of risk"".
Volenti is sometimes described as the plaintiff ""consenting to run a risk"". In this context, volenti can be distinguished from legal consent in that the latter can prevent some torts arising in the first place. For example, consent to a medical procedure prevents the procedure from being a trespass to the person, or consenting to a person visiting one's land prevents them from being a trespasser.

70	Plain_meaning_rule	"The plain meaning rule, also known as the literal rule, is one of three rules of statutory construction traditionally applied by English courts. The other two are the ""mischief rule"" and the ""golden rule"".
The plain meaning rule dictates that statutes are to be interpreted using the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute.  In other words, a statute is to be read word for word and is to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language, unless a statute explicitly defines some of its terms otherwise or unless the result would be cruel or absurd.  Ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning, technical terms are given their technical meaning, and local, cultural terms are recognized as applicable. The plain meaning rule is the mechanism that prevents courts from taking sides in legislative or political issues.  Additionally, it is the mechanism that underlies textualism and, to a certain extent, originalism."	153
79	Purcell_principle	"In United States law, the Purcell principle is the doctrine that courts should not change election rules too close to an election, because of the risk of causing confusion. It is named after Purcell v. Gonzalez, a 2006 case from the U.S. Supreme Court's emergency docket, or shadow docket. It is frequently invoked by the Supreme Court and lower courts to allow elections to proceed under a state's preferred voting requirements, maps, and other rules.The term ""Purcell principle"" was introduced in a 2016 law review article by Richard L. Hasen. It has also appeared in opinions by the justices themselves.

73	Presumption_(Catholic_canon_law)	"Presumption in the canon law of the Catholic Church is a term signifying a reasonable conjecture concerning something doubtful, drawn from arguments and appearances, which by the force of circumstances can be accepted as a proof. It is on this presumption our common adage is based: ""Possession is nine points of the law"". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:
presumption of law (juris), or that which is deduced from some legal precept or authority expressed in law or based upon precedents or similarities, and
presumption of a judge or man (judicis or hominis), when the law is silent on the subject and an opinion must be formed according to the way that circumstances and indications would affect a prudent man or judge.

101	Wrongdoing	"A wrong (from Old English wrang – 'crooked') is an act that is illegal or immoral. Legal wrongs are usually quite clearly defined in the law of a state or jurisdiction. They can be divided into civil wrongs and crimes (or criminal offenses) in common law countries, while civil law countries tend to have some additional categories, such as contraventions.
Moral wrong is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, rape or murder. Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law, but are related to unethical behaviours. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as many types of parking offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs."	117
83	Remoteness_in_English_law	"In English law, remoteness between a cause of action and the loss or damage sustained as a result is addressed through a set of rules in both tort and contract, which limit the amount of compensatory damages available for a wrong.
In negligence, the test of causation not only requires that the defendant was the cause in fact, but also requires that the loss or damage sustained by the claimant was not too remote. As with the policy issues in establishing that there was a duty of care and that that duty was breached, remoteness is designed as a further limit on a cause of action to ensure that the liability to pay damages placed on the defendant is done fairly.

66	Pacta_sunt_servanda	"Pacta sunt servanda, Latin for ""agreements must be kept"", is a brocard and a fundamental principle of law. According to Hans Wehberg, a professor of international law, ""few rules for the ordering of Society have such a deep moral and religious influence"" as this principle.In its most common sense, the principle refers to private contracts and prescribes that the provisions, i.e. clauses, of a contract are law between the parties to the contract, and therefore implies that neglect of their respective obligations is a violation of the contract. The first known expression of the brocard is in the writings of the canonist Cardinal Hostiensis from the 13th century AD, which were published in the 16th.

55	Maxwellisation	"Maxwellisation is the legal practice in English and Scots law that allows anyone who is criticised in an official report to respond prior to publication, based on details of the criticism received in advance.
The process takes its name from the publisher Robert Maxwell. In 1969, Maxwell was criticised in a report by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as ""unfit to hold the stewardship of a public company"". Maxwell took the matter to court, where the DTI was said by the judge to have ""virtually committed the business murder"" of Maxwell. To avoid any repeat following the ruling, official policy was altered to ensure that prior notice would be given of critical findings. Relevant witnesses are shown the specific extracts of reports relating to them.

7	Brady_disclosure	"In the legal system of the United States, a Brady disclosure consists of exculpatory or impeaching information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland, in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates due process.
Following Brady, the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant's sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area."	146
96	Undue_hardship	"An undue hardship is an American legal term referring to special or specified circumstances that partially or fully exempt a person or organization from performance of a legal obligation so as to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.For example, employers are required to provide a reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities, but when an accommodation becomes too taxing on the organization it is classified as an undue hardship and is no longer required.  
These hardships include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation. In the religious exemption context, undue burden is separately defined as anything ""more than de minimus"", as opposed to onerous or costly burdens.

"	122
9	Commanding_precedent	"In law, a commanding precedent is a precedent whose facts are ""on all fours"" with the case at hand. In other words, it almost exactly tracks it, sharing near-identical facts and issues. A commanding precedent is also referred to as a ""Goose"" case in Louisiana; ""Spotted Horse"" or ""Spotted Dog"" cases in Alabama; ""Cow"" case in Kansas; and ""White Horse"" or ""White Pony"" cases in Texas. A legal rule can be ""clearly established"" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by qualified immunity if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed.
